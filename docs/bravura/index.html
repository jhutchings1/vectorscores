<h1>Bravura</h1>
<h2>Encoding Bravura for inlining as data URI</h2>
<p>Certain scores rely on the dimensions of rendered fonts for additional calculations.
With <code>@font-face</code>, the font will not load before the score begins to render, giving inaccurate calculations.
Detecting the font load may require a polyfill until the CSS font loading API has more support.
In the meantime, the font can be inlined by adding <code>inline_bravura: true</code> to a score's frontmatter.</p>
<p>To encode the font, if updated, run:
<code>openssl base64 -A -in assets/fonts/Bravura.woff &gt; assets/fonts/Bravura-woff-base64</code></p>
