# *vectorscores*

<span class="vectorscores">*vectorscores*</span> is a new series of dynamic compositions by John Teske. The scores are written algorithmically so the works as a whole are crafted but the details are unique for each performance.

John has been exploring ways to express complex ideas to musicians given limitations on rehearsal time, funding, and location. <span class="vectorscores">*vectorscores*</span> uses web technology to create scores and parts for musicians that use animation to present musical material, generate and update parts in real-time, and allow a musician's choices to influence other players' parts.

<span class="vectorscores">*vectorscores*</span> is iterative and transparent, with a public code repository and the latest progress published to the website. The project is a continual work in progress, with every rehearsal and performance helping the composer further shape the works and clarify notation.

## Advantages over traditional scores
- online access to scores via web browser
- use of animation
- tutorial function for education and to aid in rehearsal—useful when dealing with complex music, tight timelines and budgets, or the absence of the composer
- unique musical possibilities including: parts generated based on input, collaboration, realtime generation of musical material, etc.
- vector graphics can be scaled and manipulated without loss of quality
<!-- - reliable use of color -->

## Performances
- list performances here or link to appropriate page
- accept performance submissions. dates, audio, video documentation

## Work concepts
- Greater control over texture and density in open instrumentation works. From core musical concepts, generate parts based on ensemble size and registers. Example: <a href="http://vectorscores.org/scores/adsr/" class="work-title">*ad;sr*</a>
- <a href="http://vectorscores.org/scores/topographies-ii/" class="work-title">Topographic scores</a>. Microcosms of sound, possibly based on data from the performers' location. Reveal score over time or by position ("fog of war").
- Music formatted as a [storyboard]. Present a musical "scene" while previewing the next, cueing and transitioning between scenes using animation.
- Open form/mobile movements, generated in realtime.
- <a href="http://vectorscores.org/scores/decision-tree/" class="work-title">*Decision Tree*</a>. At each section, performers are given a choice between two cells of music. Decisions shape the direction of the work over time.
- [Morphing clouds] of sound, smoothly transitioning between material.
- Clustering and group dynamics. Control orchestration through use of motion in score.
- Interpreting 3D graphic scores. Musicians sit around a phantom central object, parts are generated based on their position.
- <a href="http://vectorscores.org/scores/Textural-Messages/" class="work-title">*Textural Messages*</a>. Call and response between ensembles performing graphic/textural/musical content, generated in realtime.
<!-- - Cantus firmus/drone works. -->
- More to be developed as project takes shape.

## Roadmap

### Scope
The current scope of this project is to require as few dependencies as possible for ease of performances and contribution.

### Public access to works
- viewing and contribution via GitHub
- download generated vector files and pdfs of scores
- download pre-selected vector files and pdfs of scores
- clone or download repository to run on local machine or WLAN
- documentation of premiere performances and other performances as available
