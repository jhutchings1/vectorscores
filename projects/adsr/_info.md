### Notation
Time is written proportionally.
Durations are indicated by standard flags, stemless noteheads, and dotted values at 60 beats per minute.
Above each bar is its duration in seconds. <!--smaller ticks indicated seconds.-->
<!--<p>
    Boxes indciate groups of notes for phrasing and to help visualize durations.

    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="symbol">&#xe0a9;</span> ghost note : muted, pitch deemphasized

</ul>

### Pitch
As an ensemble, pick a pitch center&mdash;if the same pitch is not possible, octave transposition is allowed.
All pitch is relative to the chosen pitch center (notated as a natural sign).
Per each note in a group (or single note), you may choose a quarter-tone pitch from the given range of accidentals, relative to the pitch center.
For example, if the pitch center is D and the given range is quarter-flat to sharp,
for each note in the group you may choose C quarter-sharp, D natural, D quarter-sharp, or D-sharp.
