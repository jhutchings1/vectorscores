### Notation
Time is written proportionally.
Durations are indicated by standard flags and stemless noteheads, including dotted values, at 60 beats per minute.
Above each bar is its duration in seconds. <!--smaller ticks indicated seconds.-->
<!--<p>
    Boxes indicate groups of notes for phrasing and to help visualize durations.
</p>-->
<ul>
    <li>
        <svg class="info-cue"></svg>
        Playing the score from any bar starts with a pre-roll of 3 seconds.
        For ensemble accuracy, a leader should cue the start of the work.
        The leader should also cue bars marked with the arrow symbol.
        When starting the work or when cueing bars, musicians should play off the leader's cue and not the score pointer.
        After section A, the timing is left to each performer.

</ul>

### Pitch
As an ensemble, agree on a pitch center.
If the same pitch is not possible on all instruments, octave transposition is allowed.
All pitch is relative to the chosen pitch center (notated as <i class="symbol">&#xe261;</i>).

Per each note in a group (or single attack), a performer may choose a quarter-tone pitch from the given range of accidentals, relative to the pitch center.

For example, if the pitch center is
D<i class="symbol">&#xe261;</i> and the given range is
<i class="symbol">[ &#xe280; â€“ &#xe262; ]</i>,
for each note in the group a performer may choose
C<i class="symbol">&#xe282;</i>/D<i class="symbol">&#xe280;</i>,
D<i class="symbol">&#xe261;</i>,
D<i class="symbol">&#xe282;</i>, or
D<i class="symbol">&#xe262;</i>.
