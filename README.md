# *vectorscores*

A series of new compositions built on the web.
The works are algorithmically generated so that each score and each performance is unique while still being shaped by the composition's parameters.

## Advantages over traditional scores
- online access to scores via web browser
- use of animation
- built-in tutorial function
(for education and to reduce rehearsal time—useful when dealing with complex music, tight timelines and budgets, or the absence of the composer)
- unique musical possibilities (parts generated based on input, collaboration, realtime generation of musical material, etc.)
- vector graphics can be scaled and manipulated without loss of quality
- reliable use of color

## Performances

- accept performance submissions. dates, audio, video documentation

## Work concepts
- [*Textural Messages*]. Call and response between ensembles performing graphic/textural/musical content, generated in realtime.
- Topographic scores. Microcosms of sound, possibly based on data from the performers' location. Possible display options include: isometric projection, revealed through time or position ("fog of war"), or warped fabric?
- Interpreting 3D graphic scores. Musicians sit around a phantom central object, parts are generated based on their position.
- Music formatted as a [storyboard]. A "scenes" of music displays, giving a preview of the next scene and transitioning using animation.
- Open form/mobile movements, generated in realtime.
- Greater control over musical texture and density in open instrumentation works. From core musical concepts, generate parts based on ensemble size and registers.
- [Morphing clouds] of sound, like the murmuration of birds.
- Clustering and group dynamics. Control orchestration through use of motion in score.
- [Decision Tree]. At each section, performers are given a choice between two cells of music. Decisions shape the direction of the work over time.
- Cantus firmus/drone works.
- "Loading GIF" as timing—musical textures interrupted by technology.
- More to be developed as project takes shape.


## Support
*vectorscores* is supported by the Seattle Office of Arts & Culture.

## Roadmap

### Scope
The current scope of this project is to require as few dependencies as possible for ease of performances and contribution.

### Public access to works
- viewing and contribution via GitHub
- download generated vector files and pdfs of scores
- download pre-selected vector files and pdfs of scores
- clone or download repository to run on local machine or WLAN
- documentation of premiere performances and other performances as available
