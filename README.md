# vector scores

A series of new works to be viewed and performed via a lightweight website. The works will be algorithmically generated so that each score and each performance is unique and customized while still being shaped by the composition's parameters. Certain works may use data such as location or instrumentation to create more site- and context-specific performances.


## Advantages over traditional scores
- easily accessible and widely compatible
- reliable use of color
- use of animation
- built-in tutorial function
(for education and to reduce rehearsal time—useful when dealing with complex music, tight timelines and budgets, or the absence of the composer)
- unique musical possibilities (parts generated based on input, collaboration, realtime generation of musical material, etc.)
- vector graphics are widely compatible and can be scaled and manipulated without loss of quality

## Work concepts
- *Textural Messages*. Call and response between ensembles performing graphic/textural/musical content being generated in realtime.
- topographic scores. Microcosms of sound, possibly based on data from a user's location.
- Musically interpreting 3D objects. Any number of musicians are positioned equidistant from a phantom central object, their parts are generated based on the ensemble size. Designed to explore how we use technology to relate to abstract ideas, sometimes referring to physical objects, sometimes not.
- Music formatted as storyboard frames, transitioning between frames using animation. This could allow for performance of complex moments, allowing musicians to focus on one frame at a time.
- Open form/mobile movements, generated in realtime.
- Greater control over musical texture and density. From core musical concepts, generate parts based on ensemble size. A logical next step in algorithmically generated music and music using open instrumentation.
- Morphing clouds of sound, like the murmuration of birds.
- Clustering and group dynamics. Control orchestration through use of motion in score.
- Decision Tree. At each section, performer is given a choice between two cells of music, all branching from a single source to many possibilities. Animated similar to storyboard.
- More to be developed as project takes shape.

## Contributing
- **Performances**. Perform works created with *vector scores*. Contact me and I'll list performances here along with links to any audio and video documentation.
- **Compositions**. Use *vector scores* to create your own works. You are welcome to use my works and code as a starting point—but please make them your own!
- **Repository**. I encourage feedback and contributions to this project. Feel free to submit issues and pull requests!

## Roadmap
### Scope
The current scope of this project is to require as few dependencies as possible for ease of set up for performances and contribution. Future iterations or other projects may involve servers or other technologies.

### Public access to works
- viewing and contribution via GitHub
- download generated vector files and pdfs of scores
- download pre-selected vector files and pdfs of scores
- download local copy of repository and works to run on local machine or LAN/darknet
- documentation of premiere performances and other performances as available
